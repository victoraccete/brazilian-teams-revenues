[Notebook](https://github.com/victoraccete/brazilian-teams-revenues/blob/main/Brazilian_teams_analysis.ipynb) made with Colab. There's a link to it in the .ipynb file. The notebook is in English.  

The [csv_generator.py](https://github.com/victoraccete/brazilian-teams-revenues/blob/main/csv_generator.py) file downloads the tables from Wikipedia page and perform some initial data manipulation to generate [this dataset](https://github.com/victoraccete/brazilian-teams-revenues/blob/main/dataset/2007-2019.csv). This dataset is used in the Notebook and the streamlit app.  

The [streamlit app](https://github.com/victoraccete/brazilian-teams-revenues/tree/main/streamlit_app) can be found here. The requirements are in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/victoraccete/brazilian-teams-revenues/blob/main/requirements.txt).
